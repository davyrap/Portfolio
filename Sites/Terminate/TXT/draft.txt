Hi Jim,
I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to let you know that I discovered some items missing from my office this morning.

The stolen items include:

A black mouse – idk why they took it since it was literally falling apart
An ASCII table – What if Josie asks me to translate another message? Am I supposed to look it up on the internet?
That creepy teddy bear you always tell me to throw away (lucky you I guess)
Some stationery material

I’ve asked around to see if anyone has seen them or noticed anything unusual, but no luck so far.
I think it would be a good idea to check the security footage from that time and maybe let the security team know so we can prevent this from happening again.
Let me know how you’d like to handle this or if there’s anything else I can do.

Thanks!
