Hi Jim,
I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to let you know that I discovered some items missing from my office recently.

The stolen items include:

[A black mouse – idk why they took it since it was really worn out]
[An ASCII table – And if I needed it? What am I supposed to do? Look it up on the internet?]
[That creepy teddy bear you always tell me to throw away, lucky you I guess]
[Some stationery material]

I noticed the theft this morning. I’ve asked around to see if anyone has seen them or noticed anything unusual, but no luck so far.
I think it would be a good idea to check the security footage from that time and maybe let the security team know so we can prevent this from happening again.
Let me know how you’d like to handle this or if there’s anything else I can do.

Thanks!
